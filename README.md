The purpose of this program is to create three servers that communicate with each other (sending Person and Thing objects).


1. To run the code, open up the terminal, then switch to the wsl console (type wsl in the terminal), and then **run the `make` command**.

2. Run `./hw5GrandmaHome` to start the last server.
2. Run `./hw5Forest` to start the second server.
2. Run `./hw5Home` to start the first server.


Then, you will see the transfer of data between all the servers.
